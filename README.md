Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
To get started with the project, clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
2. Install Dependencies
This project does not require any additional libraries or dependencies. It is a static website, so you only need to have a modern web browser to view it.

3. Open in Browser
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the folder containing the files and open index.html in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

bash
Copy code
open index.html
4. Customization
You can customize the content of the website by editing the following:

About Section: Modify the text under the <section id="about">.
Projects Section: Add information about your personal projects in the <section id="projects">.
Contact Section: Update your contact email and modify the form to include any other details you'd like.
CSS Customization: Change colors, fonts, and layout by editing the style.css file to fit your style.
5. Form Functionality
The contact form uses a POST request to send the form data to submit_form.php (you need to configure this backend functionality to handle form submissions). Additionally, it includes a basic email verification field to confirm the user's email address.

For local testing or deploying to a live server, ensure that you configure an email handling system to process the form submissions.
